# NoSQL databases Practical Assignment

It is intended that each group of students carry out a work of analysis, planning, implementation of
a relational and two non-relational DBMS. To do so, they must use the Hospital Management
System relational database, whose customized script will be made available on the elearning
platform, with the designation hospital.sql.
The supplied Oracle database represents a fictitious hospital and includes various database objects,
such as tables, views, sequences, indexes, triggers, and procedures.

To do the work, the students must use one relational model and two non-relational databases:
one must be document-oriented (MongoDB) and the other graph-oriented (Neo4j).
After familiarizing each of the database models, it is intended that each group performs the following
tasks:

1. According to the provided relational schema, define and explain the processes required to
   migrate the provided data to the new non-relational systems in order to maximize each of
   the paradigms.
2. Define and implement a set of queries that allow you to demonstrate the operability of the
   implemented systems.
3. Make a critical analysis of the work done, comparing, whenever possible, the models and
   functionalities now implemented with those made available in the relational system provided.
